%title The Secret of the Golden Flower

== 1. The Celestial Mind ==

1 Naturalness is called the Way. The Way has no name or form; it is just the essence, just the primal spirit.

2 Essence and life are invisible, so they are associated with sky and light. Sky and light are invisible, so they are associated with the two eyes.

3 Since ancient times, those who realized spiritual immortality all communicated their teaching verbally, transmitting it from individual to individual.

4 Taishang appeared magically to Donghua, and the Way was handed on through a succession to Yan, then to the southern and northern schools of Complete Reality, which can be considered its full flourishing.

5 That movement flourished in the sense that there were a great many who followed it, yet it declined in the sense that is mental communication deteriorated. This has continued up to the present day, when it is extremely confused and extremely degenerate.

6 When an extreme is reached, there is a reversion. Therefore there was a certain master Siu who extended his kindness to liberate all, especially setting up the teaching of the special transmission outside of doctrine. For those who heard, it was a rare opportunity; those who accepted it formed a religious association in their time. Everyone should respectfully understand the heart of master Siu.

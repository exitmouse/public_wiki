I am fluent in spoken Mandarin. I can read and write [[German]] and Norwegian, but my conversational fluency still needs practice.

I was home schooled until the age of thirteen, a luxury that afforded me the opportunity to develop a deep exploration into mathematics as well as broad interests and a life long love of learning. I began taking math classes in the [[UMTYMP|University of Minnesota Talented Youth Mathematics Program]] at the age of eleven. There I finished multi-variable calculus at sixteen. For high school I attended the [[OHS|Stanford Education Program for Gifted Youth Online High School]] where I was fortunate to round out my skills with a variety of challenging humanities courses taught by Stanford professors.

I was a [[http://hackny.org|hackNY]] fellow. As a result I met a most astoundingly talented group of [[hackNY Fellows|hackers]], with whom I hope to stay connected to my entire life. I also got this kick-ass internship at Sailthru, where I now work full time. I got my first taste of [[New York]].

I am an employee at the sterling start-up [[http://www.sailthru.com|Sailthru]] where I get to work on challenging problems, hone my programming abilities, learn from far more experienced developers, set my own hours, attend yoga classes, eat free lunches, enjoy the company of my coworkers, attend [[Sail-ALE]] every Thursday, enjoy the spectacular view out the office windows, exercise, meditate, and generally enjoy life. 

If you like reading a [[resume]], there you have it.

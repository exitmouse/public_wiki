%title Commentary on “Ghost Train”

_Ghost Train_ is somewhat of a sequel to _Separation_. I was challenging myself by writing from a woman's perspective, specifically Aliza's. Again the writing is in present tense. This time, however, there is a lot more description. I had felt some unresolved feelings after writing _Separation_, which this story explores a bit. _Separation_ was the first time I felt like I was _really_ writing in that I was making myself as the author very vulnerable in the act. This story then, was my reflection on that.

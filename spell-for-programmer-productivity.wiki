%title Spell for Programmer Productivity

_Hermes, god of language and program solving, of wit and intelligence, bless me,
your humble servant, so that I may produce labor saving code with alacrity and
forethought. As I take the holy sacrament, modafinil, may you grant me unnatural
productivity for the next five hours, so that project time lines will be met and
product road maps mollified._

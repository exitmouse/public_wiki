%title Commentary on “The Climb”

_The Climb_ is a story I wrote in 2008 that still resonates with me to this day. The struggle of moving apart from friends and loved ones in order to achieve new heights is something I have to deal with every day in New York. I enjoy the purity of the concept in this story. I especially love the scene at the summit of the climb. I chose the name Nora because I was enamored with [[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0954253/|Nora Zehetner]] after her superlative performance in [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0393109/|Brick]].

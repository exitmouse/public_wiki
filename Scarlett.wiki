=== Chapter 1 ===

Gerard, a powerfully built and handsome man with short-cropped black hair and
large compassionate eyes, checks his Rolex and sets down his black duffle bag. He
is standing in the airport in Dublin, and impatient for his flight to board, despite
having had two Guinesses at the airport bar.

Gerard is the victim of the kind of coincidence that only occurs on fateful days,
such as this one. You see, despite the way women go wild around him, he happens
to be a software developer. As such, he was wearing a black ‘you had me at Hello World’
t-shirt. Timothy O’Cleary had been instructed earlier that day to swap duffles
with a man wearing a black ‘you had me at Hello World’ t-shirt. However, that man
was not Gerard.

This is unfortunate for Gerard because Timothy O’Cleary works for the Irish Mob.
Gerard is oblivious to the switch, and after answering a few emails using his
Pluto Corp Brain Modulator, which is capable of projecting images onto his
visual cortex in gorgeous 3240p that makes ordinary men quiver with jealousy.

The gate attendant’s heart swoons as Gerard smiles at her and bids her a good day.
And then he is on the supersonic jet back to New York City, recently declared the
greatest city in the solar system.

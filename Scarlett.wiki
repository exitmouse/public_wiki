=== Chapter 1 ===

Gerard, a powerfully built and handsome man with short-cropped black hair and
large compassionate eyes, checks his Rolex and sets down his black duffel bag. He
is standing in the airport in Dublin, and impatient for his flight to board, despite
having had two Guinesses at the airport bar.

Gerard is the victim of the kind of coincidence that only occurs on fateful days,
such as this one. You see, despite the way women go wild around him, he happens
to be a software developer. As such, he was wearing a black ‘you had me at Hello World’
t-shirt. Timothy O’Cleary had been instructed earlier that day to swap duffle bags
with a man wearing a black ‘you had me at Hello World’ t-shirt. However, that man
was not Gerard.

This is unfortunate for Gerard because Timothy O’Cleary works for the Irish Mob.
Gerard is oblivious to the switch and after answering a few emails using his
Pluto Corp Brain Modulator, which is capable of projecting images onto his
visual cortex in gorgeous 3240p that makes ordinary men quiver with jealousy, 
he gathers up what he thinks are his bags and queues up to the plane.

The gate attendant’s heart swoons as Gerard smiles at her and bids her a good day.
And then he is on the supersonic jet back to New York City, recently declared the
greatest city in the solar system.

=== Chapter 2 === 

Jenzen would be among the world’s most renowned hackers—if she weren’t so good at covering her trail. 
Like an Iroquois huntsman, she leaves no trace.
She is a consummate hacker and because she has mastered the Discipline of Do Easy
she is able to operate one of the world’s most extensive intelligence networks.

Jenzen’s only foible is her love for reflective computer monitors, which is lucky
for us, because as she catches a glimpse of her reflection in one of three screens it 
gives us a plausible excuse to describe her appearance. Unfortunately for you,
she is too beautiful for me to describe. Too bad!

Anyhoo—what she was admiring on that monitor was not her own visage, we were the
ones doing that; she was noting with satisfaction her take down of the third
child pornography ring this month. Not bad, considering it is March 3rd.

Suddenly Jenzen notices and interesting piece of intel. The Irish Mob’s private
networks are buzzing. Jenzen commands her computer, Emma, to summarize their traffic.

‘Dearest Jenzen, the Irish Mob reports that a duffle bag containing eighteen kilos
of cocaine has gone missing’ the computer says in a synthesized voice that is, surprisingly, not the least bit grating.

Eighteen kilos is fifty pounds, in case you are metrically disabled. The fact that
Gerard carried this with him without noticing attests to his great strength. Jenzen
mulls this information over. She notes that the jet is headed towards New York City,
her base of operations. Perhaps this would be an opportunity. She decides she will
keep tabs on the situation. That is to say, she won’t close the tabs that are open related to this situation.

=== Chapter 3 ===

Gerard steps into his condominium and admires it. It has a clean modern decor,
with a few very artfully chosen older pieces of furniture, and it overlooks the
Hudson River. He takes a deep breath and smells the wonderful aroma of freshly
baking peanut butter cookies. He sighs and wonders how he got to be so lucky.

Before he can ruminate more on the natural lottery and the irony he will later
see in this, his wife, Scarlett, jumps into his arms, forcing him to drop his
bags to catch her, and wraps her legs around him. 
He smiles as he muzzles her curly auburn hair. He loves
the way she smells. Right now he particularly loves the way her firm curves press 
into his muscled torso as she wiggles around slightly. She looks up at him with
her emerald eyes and blinks rapidly. Now his heart is pounding. Grabbing her ass
with his left hand and the back of her neck with his right, he kisses her passionately.

Then he closes the door behind him with a kick, and carries her into the bedroom.

=== Chapter 4 ===

Jenzen is in her secret gym. Where in Manhattan she manages to fit such a large space, full of state of the art equipment, mats, bags, and bars, is a mystery we will likely never uncover. It is rumored that the entrance is in an alley between a hair parlor and a dumpling place. Actually, I just made that up. There are no rumors about it because almost no one knows it exists.

Jenzen executes five one armed chin-ups on each arm, on her high bar, with perfect form. When she’s done, she grabs the bar with both hands, pushes up above the bar, then performs a hand stand on the high bar. This is where she breaks a sweat, because seriously, it takes a lot of muscle tone and balance to do that. Then she swings down and forward, releases, tucks her knees, performs three rolls in the air and lands on her feet at the last moment. She skips a bit before stopping, since she’s only been doing gymnastics for, like, a month.

She pauses at the end of the sequence to do a micro-meditation that relaxes and rejuvenates her muscles. Then she hears Emma.

“Jenzen, sitrep on the case of the missing cocaine. As you know, the Irish no longer have a strong presence here, so they have dispatched a group of agents to New York. They will be arriving in five hours.

=== Chapter 5 ===

A couple hours pass. After he has showered and savored the delicious cookies, which are crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside, Gerard starts unpacking. As he unzips the duffel he gasps audibly and then zips it back up. 

He looks around. Thankfully, Scarlett isn’t home anymore. She is a cardiac surgeon and was called into the hospital at a moment Gerard had found oh-so-just-oh-my-god-why-sigh. Quickly he paces to the front door, looks it, then on the way back to his bedroom closes every door behind him. Once in his room he closes all the shades. Finally he feels safe enough to unzip the bag again.

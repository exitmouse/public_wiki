I'm sitting at the Gate Clock Bar at Dublin Aiport with a pint of Guinness in hand.
Guinness is much better here in Dublin, where the tap is only miles away from the brewery.
I take a long drag and sigh. Despite how lovely Ireland is this time of year I miss home.
Mostly I miss Scarlett. 

A leggy brunette with hair as dark as my own short cropped hair sits next to me. 
She has delicate features on a V-shaped face. 
Before I can take another drink, she lays a hand on my arm. Her eyes linger there,
admiring my strong arms.

“Hey handsome, buy me a drink?” she says, as our eyes meet. I free my arm.

“Sorry, I have a flight to catch,” I say, looking at her with compassionate eyes.
I check my watch so that she can’t help
but see my wedding ring, an unadorned twist of black carbon fiber that displays
our wedding vows when viewed under UV light. 5:17 pm. Still plenty of time before
my flight.

“Oh, sorry to bother you then. Don’t mind me,” she says, with undertones of disappointment
beneath her cheerful Irish accent. I quickly finish the rest of the pint, close my tab,
and head over to gate C4.

I picked a good time to leave. Outside there is a light drizzle, and the sky is as grey as…
well, I’m not much good with similes, but my retina implant says it is grey #322. In the reflections cast by the LED lights my fellow passengers look sullen.
Having nothing better to do, I check my email on my retina.

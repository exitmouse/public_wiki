I'm sitting at the Gate Clock Bar at Dublin Aiport with a pint of Guinness in hand.
Guinness is much better here in Dublin, where the tap is only miles away from the brewery.
I take a long drag and sigh. Despite how lovely Ireland is this time of year I miss home.
Mostly I miss Scarlett. 

A leggy brunette with hair as dark as my own short cropped hair sits next to me. 
She has delicate features on a V-shaped face. 
Before I can take another drink, she lays a hand on my arm. Her eyes linger there,
admiring my strong arms.

“Hey handsome, buy me a drink?” she says, as our eyes meet. I free my arm.

“Sorry, I have a flight to catch,” I say, looking at her with compassionate eyes.
I check my watch so that she can’t help
but see my wedding ring, an unadorned twist of black carbon fiber that displays
our wedding vows when viewed under UV light. 5:17 pm. Still plenty of time before
my flight.

“Oh, sorry to bother you then. Don’t mind me,” she says, with undertones of disappointment
beneath her cheerful Irish accent. I quickly finish the rest of the pint, close my tab, pickup my black duffel bag
and head over to gate C4.

I picked a good time to leave. Outside there is a light drizzle, and the sky is as grey as…
well, I’m not much good with similes, but my retina implant says it is grey #322. In the reflections cast by the LED lights my fellow passengers look sullen.
Having nothing better to do, I check my email on my retina. Nothing is particularly interesting, as usual, but I answer a question from a new developer regarding the nature of our unnecessarily complex middle-ware system. I feel someone brush me from behind, and behind the semi-transparent retina display I see a large dark Irish behind me. He’s also clutching a black duffel, so I reflexively reach for mine and see that it is still there. He walks away, and I return to my email. 

A while later I receive a notification on my retina that my seat is ready for me. Most people receive their notification on their phones, as I am a relative pioneer of retina technology. Plane boarding is much more efficient now that the airline companies have finally been convinced that using an actual boarding algorithm rather than chaos would be more efficient. Just another way that my field has made the world better. My bag seems lighter than it did before, but my arms are probably just better rested now.

The seat next to mine is empty, so I am left to my devices and thoughts. The ridiculous superstition against having electronics on during flight has been lifted finally, but to be frank, I am tired of technology. I just want to see Scarlett again. Do you know that dull heartache when you’ve been away from your loved one? Well, it’s no longer a dull heartache. It’s more like a throbbing toothache. 

As I look out the window and I realize I won’t be able to see Dublin recede into the distance, as the clouds have covered everything. I sigh. I never thought that I would come to love someone as much as I loved Scarlett. Obviously, it is mostly upside, but then there are afternoons like this. It’s the silliest problem—of course—being so lucky as to have found someone who fulfills me completely, feeling the absence of that is almost unbearable. Traveling wouldn’t be so bad if only she could come with, but with her job as a cardiac surgeon it’s just untenable. Instead of torturing myself with this anyone, I decide to try and sleep.

My door recognizes me and I pause in front of it, listening to the faint whirl of gears. Then the door slides aside. I step into my condominium and sigh with relief. Home sweet home. For the most part the decor is sleek, modern, black and white electronic embedded plastic. But there are also some choice antique like the comfortable leather couch that Scarlett added. Scarlett also insisted on plants, and on this point we reached a happy compromise: the basil, heirloom tomatoes, and other plants all grew happily and without human interference in state of the art hydroponic systems. I sniff. The aroma of fresh baking peanut butter cookies wafts through my consciousness. It couldn't be, could it? How can a man be so lucky?

“Honey!” Scarlett lilts as she runs to embrace me. She seems to be wearing very little underneath her bright red apron which intensifies her flowing auburn hair. Before I can get any ideas she jumps at me. I have to drop the bag to catch her. “You’re hommmm—” she says, nuzzling into my chest and wrapping her legs around my waist. I can feel her soft yet firm curves against my torso as she wiggles in my grasp and kisses my neck. I lower my head and take a long deep drag of her hair.

“Scar, you smell amazing. The cookies do too. You didn’t have to ba—” I try to say, but she interrupts me with a kiss.

“Nonsense. Only the best for my papa,” she says. Thankfully the door is smart enough to close itself as I march Scarlett into the bedroom. “Ohh, someone missed me while he was away,” she teases. I just grin and lay her on our plush white king sized bed. She lays there staring into me with her light green eyes as hastily pull off my shirt. _EEEEERRROOOOOOO_ Scarlett’s phone blares from on top of the dresser. We both give it death stares. We look back at each other. Scarlett looks crestfallen, I probably look like a depressed puppy even though I’m trying not to. “Sorry Gerard, duty calls,” she says. I nod knowingly as she starts to get dressed. Suddenly I feel more tired from my travels, so I lie down as Scar bustles about. Off to save more lives. If only it were my heart that was throbbing, she might be able to help me right now. “Bye honey!” she says on her way out. 

“See you tonight, Scar,” I manage. It took her maybe three minutes to get ready. When we were dating that was something I loved about her: quick dresser; made adventures possible. Well, now that she’s gone, there’s no point in wasting time. Might as well shower. I’m happy the oven is also smart enough to turn itself off when the cookies are baked. Programmers have really managed to remove about eighty percent of the drudgery for the two percent of people who can afford it. When I step in the shower it automatically starts washing me in the sequence I preprogrammed. Scarlett is more old school, she likes to use the manual controls. Metal knobs and such nonsense. After I shower and I savor two of the cookies. The oven has kept them at the ideal temperature. They are crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. 

It takes me a moment to summon the motivation to walk back to the front door and pick up my duffel. I bring it back into the bedroom, plop it on the bed and unzip it. White bricks. I zip it back up and stare. That can’t be right. Suddenly I feel incredibly paranoid. I use my retina to tell to the house controls to lock all doors and shade all the windows. Then I unzip the bag again. There’s no mistaking it. Instead of my luggage, there are white bricks in my bag. With trembling hands I unpack them all, counting as I go. Eighteen in all. Very dense, very hard packed. I pace back and forth across my room. Okay, I know what to do. I rush out of the room and return with the kitchen scale and a knife.

I place one of the bricks on the scale. One kilogram. Whatever this is, there is a lot of it. I carefully slice off a tiny portion from the corner of a brick with the knife and contemplate it. Testing this probably isn’t the best idea, but I have no other means of identification here. What the hell. I walk carefully over to my dresser with the corner chunk balanced on my knife and dump the chunk on the shiny black plastic.

I chop it up into a fine powder, like I’ve seen them do in the movies. Then I pull out my wallet and remove a one dollar bill. Ehhh, I put it back and remove a hundred dollar bill. Go big or go home, kid. I roll it up into a tube and kneel before the dresser, exhale deeply, bring the tube to my right nostril and plug my left, and then all at once take a big snort, sucking it all up like a vacuum cleaner.

For a moment I feel nothing, and I want to laugh. It might be nothing. Compressed bricks of flour or talcum powder. Then I feel the burn. Like fire and barbed wire raking across my entire nasal cavity.

“SON OF A BITCH!” I yell. Then the burn gives way to the rush. Oh, the rush. Ohhhhhhhhh. I feel like I am falling through a tunnel of crinkling aluminum and then I land inside myself… only I am better than myself. I am turbo-freaking-charged Gerard. I clench my hands into fists. I am so strong. SO STRONG. I feel like I can hurl tables and crush skulls. But what’s this? My brain? Oh, it’s moving so fast. So many thoughts. So many brilliant thoughts. I think I am the smartest man there ever was. I probably am. How could I not have seen this before? I obviously am. It’s never been so clear. There is no doubt in my mind that I can do anything I want. All the things. Every of the things. The things, the things.

Okay, calm down. My heart is racing. I pace. Yes, this is the stuff. This is the stuff. What stuff is this? This is coke. This is coke. Calm down. Take a chill pill. Don’t take a chill pill. Enjoy this rush. I can’t have it again. Gotta use this wisely. Yes, have to sell it. Can’t use it. Have to, have to. Maybe just a little bit more. A little more. Just a little. Okay, just a little. A little line. A little line isn’t much. Okay, okay. Okay buddy.

But wait. Thinking first. Do the smart thing first. Use it as a reward. Good Gerard, good. I am smart, use the brain.

I turn on privacy mode on my retina and determine that the market value of a single brick is around twenty thousand dollars, depending on my ability to sling it. Three hundred and sixty thousand dollars. Damn. Even with my salary and Scarlett’s salary that seems like a lot of money. Especially to get all at once, tax free.

Then I realize. The bag is bugged. It must be bugged. No way it isn’t. How to get rid of the bug? Where is the bug? Burn the bag? Burn the bag. Burn the bag! Burn. Yes, yes. No, no, I’m a hacker for god’s sake.

I grab the bag and run to my workshop. The shelves of this small room are strewn with electronic gadgets, tools, soldering irons, a fabrication machine, discarded monitors, and miles of cable. I search the shelves until I find my EM field detecting wand. I sweep everything off my workbench and drop the bag on it, then begin methodically scanning the bag with the wand. Nothing, nothing. Then finally, *beep beep*. The bug must be embedded in the fabric somewhere. I grab a pair of wire cutters and begin cutting apart the fabric until I unveil a small black chip, about a quarter the area of my thumbnail. I extract it carefully.

A normal person’s instinct here would be to destroy the chip immediately. But I have better ideas. I turn on my workshop computer, and while it is booting up search for a set of wires. When I find the green cord I am looking for I solder two electrodes from one end of it to the chip, and then plugs the other end into my computer. I’m familiar with this kind of chip. It’s a generic component manufactured in Africa.

Quickly he writes a program. Unfortunately, the tracker has already indicated this apartment. There’s no getting around what’s already been revealed. For the time being, he feels very justified in paranoia. If there is a tracking chip, there are almost certainly people coming for it. Maybe he can throw them off his trail, so long as they don’t find him here. The program will hack the memory address containing the chip’s location and cause it to display whatever coordinates Gerard desires. Gerard decides that it is imperative they don’t realize the chip has been compromised, so he programs the chip to shown his location as moving from his apartment to a series of motels and hideouts, as if the chip were tracking his location while on the run.

Gerard smiles in satisfaction. This way he can even survey from a distance a location that the chip reports him to be, and see who shows up, if anyone.

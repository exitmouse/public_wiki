I'm sitting at the Gate Clock Bar at Dublin Aiport with a pint of Guinness in hand.
Guinness is much better here in Dublin, where the tap is only miles away from the brewery.
I take a long drag and sigh. Despite how lovely Ireland is this time of year I miss home.
Mostly I miss Scarlett. 

A leggy brunette with hair as dark as my own short cropped hair sits next to me. 
She has delicate features on a V-shaped face. 
Before I can take another drink, she lays a hand on my arm. Her eyes linger there,
admiring my strong arms.

“Hey handsome, buy me a drink?” she says, as our eyes meet. I free my arm.

“Sorry, I have a flight to catch,” I say, looking at her with compassionate eyes.
I check my watch so that she can’t help
but see my wedding ring, an unadorned twist of black carbon fiber that displays
our wedding vows when viewed under UV light. 5:17 pm. Still plenty of time before
my flight.

“Oh, sorry to bother you then. Don’t mind me,” she says, with undertones of disappointment
beneath her cheerful Irish accent. I quickly finish the rest of the pint, close my tab, pickup my black duffel bag
and head over to gate C4.

I picked a good time to leave. Outside there is a light drizzle, and the sky is as grey as…
well, I’m not much good with similes, but my retina implant says it is grey #322. In the reflections cast by the LED lights my fellow passengers look sullen.
Having nothing better to do, I check my email on my retina. Nothing is particularly interesting, as usual, but I answer a question from a new developer regarding the nature of our unnecessarily complex middle-ware system. I feel someone brush me from behind, and behind the semi-transparent retina display I see a large dark Irish behind me. He’s also clutching a black duffel, so I reflexively reach for mine and see that it is still there. He walks away, and I return to my email. 

A while later I receive a notification on my retina that my seat is ready for me. Most people receive their notification on their phones, as I am a relative pioneer of retina technology. Plane boarding is much more efficient now that the airline companies have finally been convinced that using an actual boarding algorithm rather than chaos would be more efficient. Just another way that my field has made the world better. My bag seems lighter than it did before, but my arms are probably just better rested now.

The seat next to mine is empty, so I am left to my devices and thoughts. The ridiculous superstition against having electronics on during flight has been lifted finally, but to be frank, I am tired of technology. I just want to see Scarlett again. Do you know that dull heartache when you’ve been away from your loved one? Well, it’s no longer a dull heartache. It’s more like a throbbing toothache. 

As I look out the window and I realize I won’t be able to see Dublin recede into the distance, as the clouds have covered everything. I sigh. I never thought that I would come to love someone as much as I loved Scarlett. Obviously, it is mostly upside, but then there are afternoons like this. It’s the silliest problem—of course—being so lucky as to have found someone who fulfills me completely, feeling the absence of that is almost unbearable. Traveling wouldn’t be so bad if only she could come with, but with her job as a cardiac surgeon it’s just untenable. Instead of torturing myself with this anyone, I decide to try and sleep.

My door recognizes me and I pause in front of it, listening to the faint whirl of gears. Then the door slides aside. I step into my condominium and sigh with relief. Home sweet home. For the most part the decor is sleek, modern, black and white electronic embedded plastic. But there are also some choice antique like the comfortable leather couch that Scarlett added. Scarlett also insisted on plants, and on this point we reached a happy compromise: the basil, heirloom tomatoes, and other plants all grew happily and without human interference in state of the art hydroponic systems. I sniff. The aroma of fresh baking peanut butter cookies wafts through my consciousness. It couldn't be, could it? How can a man be so lucky?

“Honey!” Scarlett lilts as she runs to embrace me. She seems to be wearing very little underneath her bright red apron which intensifies her flowing auburn hair. Before I can get any ideas she jumps at me. I have to drop the bag to catch her. “You’re hommmm—” she says, nuzzling into my chest. I can feel her soft yet firm curves against my torso as she wiggles in my grasp and kisses my neck. I lower my head and take a long deep drag of her hair.

“Scar, you smell amazing. The cookies do too. You didn’t have to ba—” I try to say, but she interrupts me with a kiss.

“Nonsense. Only the best for my papa.”

=== Chapter 1 ===

Gerard, a powerfully built and handsome man with short-cropped black hair and
large compassionate eyes, checks his Rolex and sets down his black duffel bag. He
is standing in the airport in Dublin, and impatient for his flight to board, despite
having had two Guinesses at the airport bar.

Gerard is the victim of the kind of coincidence that only occurs on fateful days,
such as this one. You see, despite the way women go wild around him, he happens
to be a software developer. As such, he was wearing a black ‘you had me at Hello World’
t-shirt. Timothy O’Cleary had been instructed earlier that day to swap duffel bags
with a man wearing a black ‘you had me at Hello World’ t-shirt. However, that man
was not Gerard.

This is unfortunate for Gerard because Timothy O’Cleary works for the Irish Mob.
Gerard is oblivious to the switch and after answering a few emails using his
Pluto Corp Brain Modulator, which is capable of projecting images onto his
visual cortex in gorgeous 3240p that makes ordinary men quiver with jealousy, 
he gathers up what he thinks are his bags and queues up to the plane.

The gate attendant’s heart swoons as Gerard smiles at her and bids her a good day.
And then he is on the supersonic jet back to New York City, recently declared the
greatest city in the solar system.

=== Chapter 2 === 

Jenzen would be among the world’s most renowned hackers—if she weren’t so good at covering her trail. 
Like an Iroquois huntsman, she leaves no trace.
She is a consummate hacker and because she has mastered the Discipline of Do Easy
she is able to operate one of the world’s most extensive intelligence networks.

Jenzen’s only foible is her love for reflective computer monitors, which is lucky
for us, because as she catches a glimpse of her reflection in one of three screens it 
gives us a plausible excuse to describe her appearance. Unfortunately for you,
she is too beautiful for me to describe. Too bad!

Anyhoo—what she was admiring on that monitor was not her own visage, we were the
ones doing that; she was noting with satisfaction her take down of the third
child pornography ring this month. Not bad, considering it is March 3rd.

Suddenly Jenzen notices and interesting piece of intel. The Irish Mob’s private
networks are buzzing. Jenzen commands her computer, Emma, to summarize their traffic.

‘Dearest Jenzen, the Irish Mob reports that a duffle bag containing eighteen kilos
of cocaine has gone missing’ the computer says in a synthesized voice that is, surprisingly, not the least bit grating.

Eighteen kilos is fifty pounds, in case you are metrically disabled. The fact that
Gerard carried this with him without noticing attests to his great strength. Jenzen
mulls this information over. She notes that the jet is headed towards New York City,
her base of operations. Perhaps this would be an opportunity. She decides she will
keep tabs on the situation. That is to say, she won’t close the tabs that are open related to this situation.

=== Chapter 3 ===

Gerard steps into his condominium and admires it. It has a clean modern decor,
with a few very artfully chosen older pieces of furniture, and it overlooks the
Hudson River. He takes a deep breath and smells the wonderful aroma of freshly
baking peanut butter cookies. He sighs and wonders how he got to be so lucky.

Before he can ruminate more on the natural lottery and the irony he will later
see in this, his wife, Scarlett, jumps into his arms, forcing him to drop his
bags to catch her, and wraps her legs around him. 
He smiles as he muzzles her curly auburn hair. He loves
the way she smells. Right now he particularly loves the way her firm curves press 
into his muscled torso as she wiggles around slightly. She looks up at him with
her emerald eyes and blinks rapidly. Now his heart is pounding. Grabbing her ass
with his left hand and the back of her neck with his right, he kisses her passionately.

Then he closes the door behind him with a kick, and carries her into the bedroom.

=== Chapter 4 ===

Jenzen is in her secret gym. Where in Manhattan she manages to fit such a large space, full of state of the art equipment, mats, bags, and bars, is a mystery we will likely never uncover. It is rumored that the entrance is in an alley between a hair parlor and a dumpling place. Actually, I just made that up. There are no rumors about it because almost no one knows it exists.

Jenzen executes five one armed chin-ups on each arm, on her high bar, with perfect form. When she’s done, she grabs the bar with both hands, pushes up above the bar, then performs a hand stand on the high bar. This is where she breaks a sweat, because seriously, it takes a lot of muscle tone and balance to do that. Then she swings down and forward, releases, tucks her knees, performs three rolls in the air and lands on her feet at the last moment. She skips a bit before stopping, since she’s only been doing gymnastics for, like, a month.

She pauses at the end of the sequence to do a micro-meditation that relaxes and rejuvenates her muscles. Then she hears Emma.

“Jenzen, sitrep on the case of the missing cocaine. As you know, the Irish no longer have a strong presence here, so they have dispatched a group of agents to New York. They will be arriving in five hours.

=== Chapter 5 ===

A couple hours pass. After he has showered and savored the delicious cookies, which are crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside, Gerard starts unpacking. As he unzips the duffel he gasps audibly and then zips it back up. 

He looks around. Thankfully, Scarlett isn’t home anymore. She is a cardiac surgeon and was called into the hospital at a moment Gerard had found oh-so-just-oh-my-god-why-sigh. Quickly he paces to the front door, locks it, then on the way back to his bedroom closes every door behind him. Once in his room he closes all the shades. Finally he feels confident enough to unzip the bag again.

With a slight tremble he unpacks the solid white bricks one at a time, counting as he goes. Eighteen in all. Gerard paces back and forth across his room. Suddenly he stops, eyebrow raised. Then he rushes out of the room and returns with a kitchen scale and a knife.

First, he places one of the bricks on the scale. One kilogram. Whatever this is, there is a lot of it. Gerard carefully slices off a tiny portion corner of a brick with the knife and contemplates it. He hesitates for a while. Then he figures, what the hell, life is what you make of it, walks carefully over to his dresser and dumps the corner chunk on the wooden surface. 

Gerard chops it up into a fine powder, like he’s seen them do in the movies. Then he pulls out his wallet and removes a one dollar bill. Reconsidering, he puts it back and removes a hundred dollar bill. Go big or go home, kid. Rolling it up into a tube he kneels before the dresser, exhales deeply, brings the tube to his right nostril and plugs his left, and then all at once takes a big snort, sucking it all up like a vacuum cleaner.

For a moment Gerard felt nothing, and he wanted to laugh. It might be nothing. Compressed bricks of flour or talcum powder. Then he felt the burn.

“SON OF A BITCH!” Gerard yells. Then the burn gives way to the rush. Oh, the rush. Ohhhhhhhhh. He feels like he is falling through a tunnel of crinkling aluminum and then he lands inside himself… only he is better than himself. He is turbo-freaking-charged Gerard. He clenches his hands into fists. He is so strong. SO STRONG. He feels like he can hurl tables and crush skulls. But what’s this? His brain? Oh, it’s moving so fast. So many thoughts. So many brilliant thoughts. He thinks he is the smartest man there ever was. He probably is. How could he not have seen this before? He obviously is. It’s never been so clear. There is no doubt in his mind that he can do anything he wants. All the things. Every of the things. The things the things. 

Okay, calm down. His heart is racing. He paces. Yes, this is the stuff. This is the stuff. What stuff is this? This is coke. This is coke. Calm down. Take a chill pill. Don’t take a chill pill. Enjoy this rush. You can’t have it again. Gotta use this wisely. Yes, have to sell it. Can’t use it. Have to, have to. Maybe just a little bit more. A little more. Just a little. Okay, just a little. A little line. A little line isn’t much. Okay, okay. Okay buddy. 

But wait. Thinking first. Do the smart thing first. Use it as a reward. Good Gerard, good. You are smart, use the brain.

He turns on privacy mode on his PCBM and determines that the market value of a single brick was around twenty thousand dollars, depending on his ability to sling it. Three hundred and sixty thousand dollars. Damn. Even with his software developer salary and his wife’s heart surgeon salary that seems like a lot of money. Especially to get all at once, tax free.

Then he realizes. The bag is bugged. It must be bugged. No way it isn’t. How to get rid of the bug? Where is the bug? Burn the bag? Burn the bag. Burn the bag! Burn. Yes, yes. No, no, you're a hacker for god’s sake. 

Gerard grabs the bag and runs to his workshop. The shelves of this small room are strewn with electronic gadgets, tools, soldering irons, a fabrication machine, discarded monitors, and miles of cable. Gerard searches the shelves until he finds his EM field detecting wand. He sweeps everything off his workbench and plops the bag down on it, then begins methodically scanning the bag with the wand. Nothing, nothing. Then finally, *beep beep*. The bug must be embedded in the fabric somewhere. Gerard grabs a pair of wire cutters and begins cutting apart the fabric until he unveils a small black chip, about a quarter the area of his thumbnail. He extracts it carefully.

A normal person’s instinct here would be to destroy the chip immediately. But Gerard had better ideas. He turns on his workshop computer, and while it is booting up searches for a set of wires. When he’s found the green cord he is looking for he solders two electrodes from one end of it to the chip, and then plugs the other end into his computer. He’s familiar with this kind of chip. It’s a generic component manufactured in Africa. 

Quickly he writes a program. Unfortunately, the tracker has already indicated this apartment. There’s no getting around what’s already been revealed. For the time being, he feels very justified in paranoia. If there is a tracking chip, there are almost certainly people coming for it. Maybe he can throw them off his trail, so long as they don’t find him here. The program will hack the memory address containing the chip’s location and cause it to display whatever coordinates Gerard desires. Gerard decides that it is imperative they don’t realize the chip has been compromised, so he programs the chip to shown his location as moving from his apartment to a series of motels and hideouts, as if the chip were tracking his location while on the run. 

Gerard smiles in satisfaction. This way he can even survey from a distance a location that the chip reports him to be, and see who shows up, if anyone.

Dear Matthew,

You should practice gratitude. This is a skill you have used to great effect recently, and you should make sure to continue developing it. Being gratified is amazing. Contrary to what you used to think, the path to gratification is not through the endless fulfillment of desireâ€”this only leads to increasing hunger and striving. Rather, the path to gratification is through gratitude.

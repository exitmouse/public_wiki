[[Separation]] is one of my earliest works. It began as an experiment in writing a story using only dialogue in the early drafts. It still has that feel to it, but in the interest of pragmatism some description was inserted. If it feels like several stories in one, that's because it is. I combined several story ideas to birth this. At the time I wrote this I was very much a hopeless romantic, thus I poured a lot of pathos into this. As hinted at in the story itself, the writing process was therapeutic for me, and helped me overcome a few unrequited loves that I was nursing. I'm quite fond of this story overall, and I think it reflects the many weeks I labored over it. The writing process was fairly frustrating, I tried six different permutations of verb tense and narrative perspective before I settled on the current outcome. This was my first attempt at writing in present tense, and I rather liked it. It is my first story to feature the idea of self-fulfilling prophecy, a theme that has become increasingly prominent in my writing.

[[A Stone's Fall]] is another early work. I was inspired by Alan Moore's _Watchmen_ to try embedding textual documents within the story to advance the plot. That device may or may not be successful, I'm unable to judge it. This was written during a dark time in my life, perhaps the second darkest overall, and it certainly reflects a lot of angst that I felt in high school. In retrospect my high school experience was fantastic, but I couldn't see it for what it was at the time. I had originally just intended to write a fantasy story about a living gargoyle, a trope I found fascinating, but the concept kept changing as I was writing it. I couldn't bear to write a story that didn't mean anything to me. Due to my difficulties writing from a woman's perspective in [[Separation]] I was doubly determined to write from Natalie's perspective in this story. I don't know that I really succeeded in realistically portraying a woman and I still don't have the life experience necessary to determine that.

[[Ghost Train]] is somewhat of a sequel to [[Separation]]. Once again I was attempting to challenge myself by writing from a woman's perspective, specifically Aliza's. Again the writing is in present tense. This time, however, there is a lot more description. I guess I had felt I still had some unresolved feelings after writing [[Separation]], which this story explores a bit. [[Separation]] was the first time I felt like I was _really_ writing in that I was making myself as the author very vulnerable in the act. This story then, was in large part my reflecting on that.

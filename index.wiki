%title my brain on zen

Hi, I'm [[Matthew Bunday]]. I'm interested in how we experience consciousness and the world around us, how mathematics seems to be the ‘source code’ of the universe, how we can work together to design efficient systems, and how language interacts with thought.

I offer consulting services in programming, writing, and [[meditation]]. I formerly offered competitive math coaching; if you desperately want this service, it can be negotiated, but my rates will be unreasonable.

I am fluent in Mandarin. I can read and write [[German]] and Norwegian, but my conversational fluency still needs practice. I’d love to learn more languages including Arabic, French, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish. 

I write [[Fiction|fiction]]. I also write [[Stories|stories]].

I [[advice-for-myself|write to myself]]. And I love to [[playground|play with ideas]].

I like these [[Quotes|quotes]] and these [[Links|links]].

Here are some miscellaneous articles:
* [[Guiding Principles]]
* [[Becoming Myself]]
* [[The Power of a Rubber Band]]
* [[Quit Masturbating]]
 
If you are curious about how this site is made, you may read the [[colophon]].

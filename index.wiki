%title zencephalon: Matthew Bunday's brain on zen

Hi, I'm Matthew Bunday. I'm interested in how we experience consciousness and the world around us, how mathematics seems to be the 'source code' of the unverise, how we can work together to design efficient systems, and how language interacts with thought.

I offer consulting services in [[competitive math]], [[programming]], and [[meditation]].

I am fluent in Mandarin, but functionally illiterate. I can read German and Norwegian, however, I am only a mediocre conversationalist in either.

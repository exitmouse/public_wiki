%title Spell to gain Wealth

_Today, everyday, I realize that I have everything I need. I am content with my material possessions. In fact, I am burdened. May someone in need come relieve me of an object._

As with all spells, it is best effective when you chant it with conviction and the firm belief that it will work.
